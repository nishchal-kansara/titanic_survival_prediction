# Titanic Survival Prediction
- Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.
- The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

# Overview
- This project predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on data like age, gender, ticket class, and fare.
- Logistic Regression & Random Forest Classifier
